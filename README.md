# About
Hello everyone!<br>
I am Anik Mitra, a student of Techno Main Salt Lake, affiliated to MAKAUT university.<br>
This set of programs are all the programs we learnt during our 2nd semester.<br>
All the source codes are in C langauage.<br>

## How to run?
At first, you will be needing a compiler.<br>
If using *VSCode*, install **MinGW** compiler and activate it.<br>
Install Code runner and then click on "run code" to run the programs.<br>
If using *codeblocks*, compiler is already present, so just copy the whole code and run it.<br>
