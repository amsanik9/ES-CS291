# About
Hello everyone!<br>
I am Anik Mitra, a student of Techno Main Salt Lake, affiliated to MAKAUT university.<br>
This set of programs are all the programs we learnt during our 2nd semester.<br>
All the source codes are in C langauage.<br>

## How to run?
At first, you will be needing a compiler.
If using VSCode, install MinGW compiler and activate it.
Install Code runner and then clicl on "run code" to run the programs.
If using coideblocks, compiler is already present, so just copy the whole code and run it.
